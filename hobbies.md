##SOME OF MY HOBBIES

I enjoy playing old videogames and tinkering with emulators and old videogame hardware.

I like reading non-fiction books, especially about science and history. (And the history of science!)

I wrote and self-published a novel when I was in my early twenties! I haven't written much fiction since.
