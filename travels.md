##SOME OF MY TRAVELS

I spent a year abroad in England when I was 20, working out of the University of Exeter. I traveled often to London!

During that year, I also went to Dublin, Prague, and Athens, though I'm embarrassed to admit I never made it across the Chunnel to Paris.

A few years back, I took a group of middle-schoolers to Costa Rica and visited the Cloud Forest at Monteverde. It was beautiful!

My favorite trip, though, was driving the entirety of Route 66, from its origin in Chicago to its terminus at the Santa Monica Pier in LA.
