##MOTIVATIONS

I'm changing my career for a couple reasons: I'd like to move away from teaching after more than a decade in the classroom, I'd like to make more money, and I'd like to work in a field which is friendly to remote work because I want to stay in Cleveland, near my family, but I'd like broader employment options than what is local.
